<p>In this project, we explored the interaction between software and hardware, specifically as it related to executing code on a CPU.</p> 

<p>To do this, we wrote a simple assembler and emulator. An assembler takes in human-language instructions and outputs machine instructions (1s and 0s), while an emulator executes the machine instructions in the same way a physical CPU would. We used C to assemble a MIPS instruction set: MIPS is a simple assembly language. Our assembler and emulator supports the following instructions: LW, SW, J, JR, JAL, BNE, XORI, ADD, SUB, and SLT. It takes as input an assembly file with those instructions, which our assembler then converts into 32-bit hexadecimal machine code that our emulated hardware can execute. As an example, an assembly input could be “add $t3 $t0 $t1“ and an output could be “0x01095820”. In this case, “add” tells the assembler that this is an add operation, $t3 is the register the result will be stored in, and $t0 and $t1 are the two registers that the data should be added from. After receiving the machine instructions (“0x01095820”), our emulator (written in Python) would run that instruction through our CPU module. This allows us to virtually emulate the results and machine operations of this instruction as it is executed in the CPU. </p>

<p>To ensure our assembler outputs executable machine code and to gain understanding about the execution of programs in our CPU, we will design and build an emulator in Python. The program will execute in a terminal prompt with an Assembly file and flags as input. It will then use our assembler to generate an instruction memory file for our iVerilog CPU and execute the instructions on the emulated hardware. Depending upon the flags the user specifies, the program will either execute in full and display register values, or execute in part and wait for further input before continuing. If we find that our emulator is lacking functionality, we will incorporate additional flags as options. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>Over the course of this class, we have built a CPU and the lower-level modules needed to run a CPU, all in Verilog, a hardware description language which allows us to write at an extremely low level. We then used an assembly language (MIPS), which is slightly higher-level, to build functions to test the CPU. It seemed like the logical next step to build a higher-level program to run our assembly functions and our Verilog CPU. This also allowed us to gain even greater understanding of the different levels of computer architecture, and how it relates to us as software engineers.</p>
